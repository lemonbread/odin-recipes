        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potatoes came from the new world. Thus far the best forms of potatoes are fries (usually "chips" in the UK) and potato chips (or "crisps").</p>
        <p>There is a legend that fries were tastier when they were commonly fried in beef tallow as opposed to vegetable oil. I am not a nutritionist, but for my recipe I will obey the tallow legend.</p>
        <p>Proceed with caution: Fries are some of the tastiest foodstuffs known to man. Please consult a specialist before incorporating tallow fried fries into your diet permanently.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 & 1/2 to 2 sticks of beef tallow in a small pot.</li>
            <li>Portion your fries from your freezer into a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Wait about one minute after all of the tallow has melted.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the fries into the pot. You may like to use a metal straining spoon(?) to guide them in.</li>
            <li>Wait about 7 minutes or until fries are hard and of your preferred colour.</li>
            <li>Patiently lift fries out of the pot with your straining spoon and place them into the bowl you used earlier.</li>
            <li>Wait about 2â€“4 minutes (depending on the thickness of your fries). (Consider using this time to finish prepping other meal items.)</li>
            <li>Dress with salt, chilli powder, pepper etc to taste. Also consider dips like mayo and/or hot sauce, ketchup, etc.</li>
            <li>Eat the fries.</li>
        </ol>
